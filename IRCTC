IRCTC :
Right now there are 26 cities in karnataka, suppose  CM of UP [aditya nath yogi] changes the city name allahabad to prayagraj
- You work as a tester for IRCTC and the destination or Source name has been changed 
- This will effect the ticket booking flow and ticket booked flow ?
- Most of the customers are not aware of this small change 
- We have to provide a good customer experience without giving wrong information 

In this the API's like get all cities, Change City Name and Delete City can be used

Task is to give postitive and negative test cases, also corner cases or citical bugs, realted to UI or Backend is expected
